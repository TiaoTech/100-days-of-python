# 🎸 Band Name Generator – Day 1 Project

This was my **Day 1 project** from the *100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp* by Dr. Angela Yu.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to print messages using `print()`
- Getting user input with `input()`
- Storing data in variables
- Basic string concatenation
- How to run and test Python code in an IDE

## 🚀 How It Works

The program asks the user two questions:
1. What city did you grow up in?
2. What is the name of a pet?

It then combines these two answers to generate a fun band name suggestion like:

Your band name could be Toronto Tiger

## 🗂️ File
- `day-1-band-name-generator.py`

This was a fun and simple introduction to writing interactive programs!
