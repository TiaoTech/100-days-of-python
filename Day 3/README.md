# 🏝️ Treasure Island – Python Adventure Game

This is a simple text-based adventure game written in Python as part of Day 3 of my 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp.

## 🚀 About the Project

Your mission is to find the treasure hidden deep within the mysterious island. The game involves a series of choices where you'll explore paths, encounter creatures, and try to survive long enough to discover the treasure chest.

Along the way, you'll face:
- A haunted boat dock
- A mysterious log cabin
- A deadly lake
- A minotaur guarding the woods
- A final test of fate behind three doors

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control flow
- Nesting conditionals to create branching paths
- Handling user input and sanitizing it with `.lower()`
- Managing game state using Boolean flags
- Writing interactive stories with multiple outcomes

## 🧪 How to Play

1. Run the Python script (`treasure_island.py`) in your terminal or IDE.
2. Follow the prompts and type your answers (e.g., `left`, `yes`, `yellow`)
3. Try to reach the treasure without dying!

## 💡 Bonus Features

- Custom narrative with branching storylines
- Input validation with default fail states
- Epic boss fight (Minotaur optional)

## 🗂️ File

- `treasure_island.py` – main game script
