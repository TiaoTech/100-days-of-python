# ✊📄✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors – Day 4 Project

This is my **Day 4 project** from the *100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp* by Dr. Angela Yu.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To create a playable version of the classic game **Rock, Paper, Scissors**, where a user selects one of the three options and plays against a computer that makes a random choice.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use the `random` module in Python
- Storing and accessing items in a list
- Handling user input with `input()` and `int()`
- Building game logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Input validation to prevent crashes and invalid choices

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program asks the user to type `0` for Rock, `1` for Paper, or `2` for Scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The user and computer choices are displayed using ASCII art.
4. The game logic then determines if the user won, lost, or tied.
5. If the user inputs an invalid number, the game informs them and ends.

## 📌 Notes

This project helped reinforce the use of lists, conditionals, and random number generation in Python. It was also a fun way to practice input validation and logical structuring.
