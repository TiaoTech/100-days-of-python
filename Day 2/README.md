# 💰 Tip Calculator – Day 2 Project

This is my **Day 2 project** for the *100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp*. It calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Python data types: `int`, `float`, and `str`
- Type conversion with `int()` and `float()`
- Basic math and operator use
- Rounding numbers with `round()`
- Using f-strings to format output

## 🚀 How It Works

The program asks the user to input:
1. The total bill amount
2. The tip percentage they'd like to give (e.g., 10, 12, or 15)
3. The number of people splitting the bill

Then it calculates the total per person and rounds the result to two decimal places.

**Example output:**

Each person will pay $15.27

## 🗂️ File
- `tip-calculator.py`

This was a great challenge for combining math with user interaction and formatting!
