# 🔐 PyPassword Generator

A beginner-friendly Python script that generates secure, customizable passwords.  
This project was built as part of my Python learning journey (Day 5) and demonstrates the use of `for` loops, lists, randomization, and user input handling.

## 💡 Features

- Customizable password length:
  - Choose how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** you want.
- Uses Python's `random` module for secure, randomized character selection.
- Shuffles the final password to avoid predictable patterns.
- Basic input validation and helpful error messages.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3  
- `random` module  
- Lists and loops  
- Terminal-based interaction

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Run the script in your terminal or IDE:

```bash
python py_password_generator.py
```

3. Follow the prompts to enter how many letters, symbols, and numbers you'd like.

## 📦 Example Output

```
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
> 5
How many symbols would you like?
> 2
How many numbers would you like?
> 3

Your password is: R8@tL#eP1
```

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to use `for` loops for repeated actions  
- How to manipulate and shuffle lists  
- How to combine user input with logic to build interactive scripts  
- Importance of validating user input

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Add a GUI version using Tkinter  
- Option to copy password to clipboard  
- Add strength rating based on character variety
